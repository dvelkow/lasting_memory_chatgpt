## Overview
This is a basic Python script that implements a chatbot that uses a chosen by the user OpenAI's model (currently Turbo) to answer questions based on a custom knowledge base. The chatbot reads from a local text file and uses that information to respond to user queries.

## Installation

First clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/dvelkow/loaded_memory_chatgpt`

Install the required dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Finally just run the "app.py" file. 

That's about it, pretty self explanatory. Also for you to use it you obviously need to replace the api_key_placeholder with yours. You can visit https://platform.openai.com if you don't have an API key.
